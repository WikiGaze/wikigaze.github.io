## WikiGaze

We propose WikiGaze, a state-of-the-art approach to utilize readers' participation in Wikipedia analysis. We capture readers' conceptual reception of an article in the form of their eye gaze pattern over the article. Applying eye-tracking to reading pattern analysis requires a fundamental trade-off between the invasiveness of the eye tracker and the accuracy of the estimated gaze points. Instead of using an expensive, invasive device like Tobii; we propose to use lightweight desk-mounted/laptop camera to perform eye gaze tracking with the help of some computer vision technique.
